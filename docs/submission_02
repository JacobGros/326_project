Overview:
Our application allows users to upload an image of their pets and vote on which one is the cutest as well as view the
leaderboards. Our project has changed since its conception in the following ways. We no longer plan to collect user votes in a seasonal bracket competition,
but currently, we want to allow users to vote once per day rather than resetting the vote counts after the season is over,  the vote counts
will not be reset.

Problems/Successes:
There were some initial issues with running the server properly, using init.py, as well as using image fields.
In addition, there were issues with being able to consistently meet up due to conflicts with schedules.  Compared to the last project phase, we weren't able to divide and independelty work on the project
as effectively because most of the components are interconnected.  There have also been some technical issues occuring for our computers.

We have sucessfully set up a means of storing and populating a database for our project.
