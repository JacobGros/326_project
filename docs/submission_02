Overview:
Our application allows users to upload an image of their pets and vote on which one is the cutest as well as view the
leaderboards. Our project has changed since its conception in the following ways. We no longer plan to collect user votes in a seasonal bracket competition,
but currently, we want to allow users to vote once per day rather than resetting the vote counts after the season is over,  the vote counts
will not be reset.
