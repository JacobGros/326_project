# Innovative Idea

A website that allows users to upload picures of their own pets and allows them to vote on which pet they think is cuter. It uses a bracket system to keep the record and users can view he rankings of pets and filter by categories like size, gender, species, etc. Users can log-in to the site so that it is not anonymous.
