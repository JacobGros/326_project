I contributed to several aspects of this project. Specifically, I created the submit.html page and fixed the formatting on the 
previous form as well as adding a chose file button, submit button, reset form button, new image with alt text, general template editing,
a select list instead of radio buttons, updating the species types based on the model, and adding other form constituiants.

In addition, I helped in association with others to create and fortify the actual implementation of submission to the database and 
preventing the users from adding a negative age to their pet before submitting. The new form allows users to choose their pet's name, 
species from a list of selected species based on the appropriate ones, and more, and will refuse to allow the user to submit without 
first logging in and selecting all consituiant data points otherwise it won't work and it will stop them and make them do it again so 
they can't submi until they have filled out all of the parts of the form with valid data.

Lastly, I provided some contribution to starting the group submission file and working with other features of the website and more. You can check the github commits and user rankings under contributors to learn more about my some of submissions and efforts.
