I contributed to multiple parts of submission 02. Initially the first thing we had trouble doing as a group was getting the server to run. I had an idea about what to do and suggested it but we never tried it so I went to office hours with Patrick and that idea ended up being correct in the end and we finally got the server to actually run.
After that issue was settled we discussed as a group how to make the model's layout and I created a few images of the models based on what we decided, changes were made later on to the models and I made the updated model images as well and contributed to discussions about implementation and layout of the site features which have changed a few times now since the starting idea. 
After this I created an initial template for the init.py file but it was full of erros which I tried to fix and the group also tried to fix init.py as well and wasn't able to make it work so Jacob made init2.py and managed to make it work and init.py was deleted and replaced by init2.py in the end.
I made a title-logo for the website for submission 02 as well but we didn't end up using it yet because there was a lot of trouble at the start of the project which set back style changes for now to bottom priority.
