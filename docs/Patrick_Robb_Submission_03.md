I contributed to both the user authentication and forms aspect of this assignment. I implemented our login and logout functionality. I also tailored our site behavior based on login status by limiting certain pages on our site to logged in users and adding functionality to navigate to a profile view for a user by clicking on 'My Profile' on the navigation bar. 
	I also implemented our registration functionality. I extended the Django user class so that we could link a user to a person(like profile) to store additional information. I created a one to one relationship between these entities in our models. When a user is created a person is also created and data within person is updated based on user. 
	Lastly, I updated our url mapping for our login and registration functionality. All of the user registration and authentication process is made available to the user through the navigation bar. I also met with the team regularly for general work and organization.
